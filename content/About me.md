<div style="text-align: justify"> My name is Kacper (like the friendly ghost). As you can see on the picture above, I like to climb. But let the picture not mislead you, I mostly do bouldering and I climb only in my free time. In my non-free time, I work as a customer data scientist. My work focuses on marketing mix modelling. I create and maintain pipelines that model customer data. Besides that, I improve our internal Bayesian model.

I have a master in Econometrics from the University of Amsterdam. I am passionate about statistics and fintech. In additon to my work, I also write articles for <a href="https://medium.com/@ksolarski">Medium</a> and contribute to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kacpersolarski">Kaggle</a>. I'm also expanding my knowledge in deep learning in NLP.</div>
